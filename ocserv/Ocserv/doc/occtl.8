.SH NAME
\f\*[B-Font]occtl\fP
\- OpenConnect VPN server control
.SH SYNOPSIS
Openconnect VPN server control (occtl) is a tool to control
the ocserv VPN server.
.SH DESCRIPTION
This a control tool that can be used to send commands to ocserv. When
called without any arguments the tool can be used interactively, where 
each command is entered on a command prompt; alternatively the tool
can be called with the command specified as parameter. In the latter
case the tool's exit code will reflect the successful execution of
the command.
