.SH NAME
occtl \- OpenConnect VPN server control
.SH SYNOPSIS
Openconnect VPN server control (occtl) is a tool to control
the ocserv VPN server. It uses D\-BUS to connect to ocserv.
.SH DESCRIPTION
This a control tool that can be used to send commands to ocserv. When
called without any arguments the tool can be used interactively, where 
each command is entered on a command prompt; alternatively the tool
can be called with the command specified as parameter. In the latter
case the tool's exit code will reflect the successful execution of
the command.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.BR  \-s " \fIfile\fP, " \-\-socket\-file "=" \fIfile\fP

This option is only needed if you have multiple servers.
.TP
.BR \-h , " \-\-help"

.TP
.BR \-! , " \-\-more-help"

.TP
.BR \-v " [{\fIv|c|n\fP}]," " \-\-version" "[={\fIv|c|n\fP}]"
Output version of program and exit.  The default mode is `v', a simple
version.  The `c' mode will print copyright information and `n' will
print the full copyright notice.
.SH "IMPLEMENTATION NOTES"
This tool uses unix domain sockets or D\-BUS to connect to ocserv (depending on compilation options).
In case D\-BUS is being use the D\-BUS access controls should be used to prevent potentially dangerous commands to be sent
to ocserv by unprivileged users.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
One of the following exit values will be returned:
.TP
.BR 0 " (EXIT_SUCCESS)"
Successful program execution.
.TP
.BR 1 " (EXIT_FAILURE)"
The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.
.TP
.BR 70 " (EX_SOFTWARE)"
